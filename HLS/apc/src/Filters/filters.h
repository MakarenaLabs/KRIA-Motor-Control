 * \brief Filters Core
 * \param s_axis Input AXI4-Stream with the following format:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Bits 0..15: First phase current \f$I_a\f$, from the ADC.
 *   <li> Bits 16..31: Second phase current \f$I_b\f$, from the ADC.
 *   <li> Bits 32..47: Speed, in RPM.
 *   <li> Bits 48..63: Angle, in encoder steps, just passed through.
 * </ul>
 * All values are 16-bit signed integers.
 *
 * \param m_axis Output AXI4-Stream, contains filtered values of the input stream in the same format.
 * \param RPM_out Returns speed, in RPM.
 * \param control Value of the control register. Zero value indicates that the motor is off.
 * \return void - functions implementing an IP core do not return a value.
