/**
 * \brief Park's transform as AXI4-Stream IP core
 *
 * It calculates the values \f$I_d\f$ and \f$I_s\f$ in the ouput AXI4-Stream \p m_axis
 * by using the following equations:
 * \f{equation}{
 *  I_d = I_\alpha \cos \theta + I_\beta \sin \theta,
 * \f}
 * \f{equation}{
 *  I_q = - I_\alpha \sin \theta + I_\beta \cos \theta,
 * \f}
 * where \f$I_\alpha\f$, \f$I_\beta\f$ and \f$\theta\f$ are from the input AXI4-Stream \p s_axis.
 *
 * \param s_axis Input AXI4-Stream with the following layout:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Bits 0..15: \f$I_a\f$, from the ADC.
 *   <li> Bits 16..31: \f$I_b\f$, from the ADC.
 *   <li> Bits 32..47: Speed, in RPM, just passed through.
 *   <li> Bits 48..63: Angle, in encoder steps.
 * </ul>
 * All values are 16-bit signed integers.
 *
 * \param m_axis Output AXI4-Stream with the following layout:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Bits 0..16: \f$I_d\f$.
 *   <li> Bits 17..31: \f$I_q\f$.
 *   <li> Bits 32..47: Speed, in RPM.
 *   <li> Bits 48..63: Angle, in encoder steps.
 * </ul>
 * All values are 16-bit signed integers.
 *
 * \return void - functions implementing an IP core do not return a value.
